# Attempt 2: --limit @retry-file (failed hosts only) if a retry file exists
# Attempt 3: full playbook again (safety net if retry-scoped attempt didn't cover
#            a cross-host dependency)

# aggressively across the ~30-host PowerPlant fleet. Controller has enough

# comfortable middle ground and matches the airfield-range deploy.sh.
